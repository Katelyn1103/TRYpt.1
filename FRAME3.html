<br>
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused millions of deaths around the world. It has affected over millions of<br>
families and it still continues to do so. Viruses constantly change through mutation so new variants of <br>
virus are expected to occur over time. Reports now has stated that there are several new Covid-19 <br>
variants found across US and other parts of the world. The Bureau of Immigration has announced the<br>
expansion of entry travel restrictions starting the midnight of January 3, 2021, for foreign passengers <br>
due to the reported new strain of COVID-19 that has recently plagued the United Kingdom. Foreigners<br>
from 21 countries such as The United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Australia, Israel, The<br>

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the school year 2020-2021 started late. The start of the school year was<br>
pushed through a distance learning set-up due to the social distancing protocol of the government that<br>
does not enable students to learn face to face. Different kinds of distance learning were implemented<br>
such as the online, modular and the blender learning. Other private schools opened the school year<br>
during the month of August but public schools moved the opening of class on October 5, 2021. There<br>
was also approved pilot implementation of face-to-face classes in low-risk areas starting January stated<br>
by the President, on December 15, 2020 but the approval was recalled five days after, on December 26,<br>
2020, due to a threat of a new Covid-19 variant. The DepEd considers a two weeks summer vacation<br>
plan to extend the school year and a lot of people wanted to reject this plan.<br>

Since the Covid-19 pandemic started, there have been 12,000 deaths in the country. It has made a lot of<br>
damages since it started infecting people causing thousands to die. The government has warned the<br>
citizens to follow the protocol and guidelines to prevent getting infected from this kind of virus, such as<br>
wearing face masks and face shields. 
<br>
<br>
At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, there was still no cure and vaccine for this virus but<br>
now there are several Covid-19 vaccines under clinical trials and the FDA is reviewing the results to<br>
approve these Covid-19 vaccines for use. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna COVID-19<br>
vaccine have only been approved for emergency use. The delivery of the initial Covid-19 vaccine to the<br>
Philippines has been delayed due to the issues that the manufacturers are currently facing, in a report of<br>
February 18, 2021.

On February 17, 2021, a tropical depression near Mindanao has entered the Philippine Area of<br>
Responsibility thus becoming the country’s first tropical cyclone for 2021. This storm named ”Auring”<br>
(international name: Dujuan) was intensified into a tropical storm on February 18, 2021.<br>
<br>
The next day, in the early morning of February 19, 2021, it intensified into a severe tropical storm but<br>
weakened back to a tropical storm during the 5:00 pm bulletin of PAG-ASA on the same day. Three days<br>
after, February 22, 2021, in its 2:00 pm bulletin, the storm weakened into a Low-Pressure Area.<br>
<br>
It was expected to dissipate as it approaches Southern Luzon. The storm “Auring” has left more than<br>
4,500 people stranded and has affected more than 53,000 people showed in the government data. The<br>
former typhoon “Auring” has left the country in a report on February 24, 2021, and has caused damages<br>
to our agriculture worth P21.43 million.<br>

<br>
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not<br>
previously been seen in humans. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more<br>
each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can<br>
also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people<br>
who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.<br>
<br>
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for<br>
the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan<br>
China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.<br>
In COVID-19, “CO” stands for corona, “VI” for virus, and ”D” for disease. Formerly, this<br>
disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”<br>
<br>
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person,<br>
including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People<br>
who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of<br>
reinfection with COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how<br>
the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.<br>
<br>
COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from<br>
person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more<br>
efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most<br>
contagious viruses known to affect people.<br>
<br>
The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver<br>
problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a<br>
condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection<br>
an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called<br>
cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs.<br>
<br>
Scientists and researchers are constantly tracking COVID-19 infections and recoveries.<br>
But they don’t have information about the outcome of every infection. Early estimates predict<br>
that the overall COVID-19 recovery rate will be between 97% and 99.75%.<br>
<br>
There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors,<br>
including researchers’ work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, the<br>
success of the vaccines, and the public’s efforts to slow the spread.<br>
